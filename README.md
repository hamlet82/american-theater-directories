# American Theater Directories

This site collects ongoing research gathering, parsing, organizing, and visualizing data from directories of American theater since the nineteenth century.
My main focus is primary sources such as guides developed for theatrical managers, actors, and students.
The work here supplements and expands my current research on [Visualizing Broadway](http://visualizingbroadway.com).
